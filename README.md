Midterm Report Calculator
===

**Milestone Project Two: Interactive Frontend Development - Code Institute.**

The purpose of this dashboard is to represent the survey results of 59 different University students (both male and female) across three different disciplines (English, Irish and Maths). Through this dashboard, we can gather and filter statistics from what this microcosm of data can indicate and tell us about a wider demographic and even speculate about what this data means within the categories they represent - most notably the trends in age and gender for students within these disciplines. Or even use the data to speculate the improvements which could change similar data sets in future for the better.

Statistical analysis is something which is vital to understanding sociological trends in society. The importance of this dashboard reflects how and why data is collected and how it is understood. In discovering trends and potential problems, organisations and, in this case, universities can anticipate and work upon these issues before they become bigger problems.

For example, the Midterm Report Calculator can be used to find a particular age group or gender who have struggled the most with their midterm and from that data collection, the issue can be investigated and reviewed further so that the standards of the course can change and improve over time â€“ thereby saving time and money.
