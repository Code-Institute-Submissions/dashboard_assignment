Midterm Report Calculator
===

**Milestone Project Two: Interactive Frontend Development - Code Institute.**

The purpose of this dashboard is to represent the survey results of 59 different University students (both male and female) across three different disciplines (English, Irish and Maths). Through this dashboard, we can gather and filter statistics from what this microcosm of data can indicate and tell us about a wider demographic and even speculate about what this data means within the categories they represent - most notably the trends in age and gender for students within these disciplines. Or even use the data to speculate the improvements which could change similar data sets in future for the better.

Statistical analysis is something which is vital to understanding sociological trends in society. The importance of this dashboard reflects how and why data is collected and how it is understood. In discovering trends and potential problems, organisations and, in this case, universities can anticipate and work upon these issues before they become bigger problems.

For example, the Midterm Report Calculator can be used to find a particular age group or gender who have struggled the most with their midterm and from that data collection, the issue can be investigated and reviewed further so that the standards of the course can change and improve over time – thereby saving time and money.


Features
---
In this section, I will describe the user available features which this project has to offer. 

**Existing Features**

*	**Filter Selectors** – Allows the user to filter the chart data by selecting options from any of the three available filters. The filters are organised by Subject, Gender, and Grade.   
*	**Interactive Pie Charts** – Allows the user to study the data related to Gender Balance, Subject Ratio, and Grade Ratio between all students surveyed. These charts are interactive and the data representation will change depending on what the user is looking to find.
*	**Interactive Bar Charts** – The Bar Charts represent the averages (by percentage) for the all students and are organised by subject and gender. These are also interactive and the data can be refined depending upon what information the user is looking for.
*	**Scatterplot** – Represents the relationship between the age of the student and the student’s result.  The scatterplot is not interactive with the user. However, the results will filter if the user is interactive with any other chart on the page. All charts are responsive to each other.
*	**Number Boxes** – Floating numbers which denote the percentage by gender who achieved a result of 70% or more. There are also number boxes organised by subject which reflect the same principle.
